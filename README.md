Token Help
==========

This module creates an administrative page that lists all tokens, like the Drupal page that was at admin/help/token but was removed in Backdrop when the admin Help menu was removed.

It also provides a developer page at admin/development/information/tokens that lists the data that various tokens need and/or provide, which is useful when developing token-related modules.
